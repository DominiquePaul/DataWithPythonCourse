# DataWithPythonCourse

This repository contains Python scripts I wrote for the Data Science Fundamentals course held by Professor Binswanger at the University of St. Gallen in Fall 2017. The three main parts consist of two chunks of R code which I 'translated' into Python equivalents and a batch of python scripts on basic Machine Learning code.
