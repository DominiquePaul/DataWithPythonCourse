# DataWithPythonCourse

This repository contains Python scripts I wrote (/"translated" from R into Python) for the Data Science Fundamentals course taught at the Universtiy of St. Gallen by Professor Johannes Binswanger in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. 

The Repository is divided into three parts: 
<ul>
  <li> Translation no. 1: Basic Python scripts introducing the students to the language
  <li> Translation no. 2: Python scripts going beyond the very basics of the language and adding some more advanced concepts
  <li> Machine Learning: Machine Learning scripts written in Python covering loss functions, normal and stochastic gradient descent, the perceptron algorithm, and the Adaline algorithm. 
</ul>
