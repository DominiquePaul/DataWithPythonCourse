# This file just contains a copy-cat version of the 
# function definition in Lec7_2.R !
# Well, a very few things are either removed or rearranged.
# But it's basically a carbon copy!

# important: we keep the import statements as well as the lines loading the data
# as the function relies on them
# alternatively, we could include additional arguments in the function passing the data 
# on to the function
